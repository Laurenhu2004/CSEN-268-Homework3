## Santa Clara University - CSEN268 Fall 2024

### Lecture 7 - 15 Oct 2024

We look at the repository pattern and continue to bloc library. Use the following to add the bloc_library to your code.

    flutter pub add flutter_bloc

#### RepositoryProvider

The tag `Lecture7Start` will already include the `RepositoryProvider` implemented.

#### Cubit

In the rest of the lecture we aim to implement the `Cubit` pattern and `Bloc` pattern

### Setting up your environment before the lecture

Each lecture is stored under a separate tag. In your computer do the following

    git clone <Repository Name>
    git pull
    git tag -l

This will list you all the tags in the repository such as

    Lecture4
    Lecture5
    Lecture6
    ...

In order to pull a particular tag to your computer

    git checkout tags/Lecture5_start -b Lecture5_study
